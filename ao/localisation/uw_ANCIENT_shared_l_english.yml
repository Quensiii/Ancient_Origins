  ### Industry Focuses ###
  ########################
    anc_industry_0:0 "Industrial Effort"
    anc_industry_0_desc:0 "The concept of standardised industry is one foriegn to many on Terra. Only the powerhouses of the wastelands and the handful of advanced civilisations remaining have manufacturing apparatuses that could be considered anything close to the idea. \n \n Yet, times are changing and it would be certainly a worthwhile idea to make a push towards bringing our industries up to a more acceptable level of sophistication. Even just announcing such a move will likely bring much hope and stability to our people."
    ### INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH ###
      anc_industry_1:0 "Industrial Research I"
      anc_industry_1_desc:0 "Our industrial knowledge and capabilities can be considered lacking at the best of times, and downright non-existent at the worst. As it is, we can barely keep our current network of garage workshops and chaotic sweatshops operational as many of the machines we use are completely irreplaceable, and likely centuries if not millennia old. \n \n Relearning the lessons of our ancestors will be an absolute necessity if we hope to truly reform our production base."
      anc_industry_2:0 "Industrial Research II"
      anc_industry_2_desc:0 "While our first efforts were impressive, perhaps the greatest recovery of industrial knowledge within our nation since the beginning of Old Night, they were not enough. Similar projects must be carried out to continue this great leap forward."
      anc_industry_3:0 "Recruit Scientists"
      anc_industry_3_desc:0 "Our previous forays into the realm of recovering the lost secrets of industry were spearheaded by an eclectic group. Soldiers, archeologists for hire and even a few monks and tech-magi all had a hand in our successes, whether through clearing out abandoned manufactorums of squatters or tinkering away for hours on end in their lairs and hideouts. \n \n For a time they were enough, but in order to continue down the path they have laid down we require a different sort. Scientists who, with the pieces of old industrial tech we have put together, will be able to truly jumpstart our industry and perhaps even other aspects of our nation’s development."
      anc_industry_4:0 "Increased Production"
      anc_industry_4_desc:0 "A major benefit of our research efforts has been the improvement of our replicator- and arms-production systems. This new efficiency comes from a dozen sources, from superior welding on machinery to entirely new devices and methods that have significantly impacted our ability to produce equipment for the better."
      anc_industry_5:0 "Faster Construction"
      anc_industry_5_desc:0 "An STC fragment is a rare thing, especially on picked-dry Terra. However, we have been blessed. An ancient bunker near our capital has been discovered, and within was stored an STC fragment, containing dozens of different modular building designs. \n \n We have recovered these blueprints and incorporated them into our construction industry. While the skyline will look a lot more boring in the future, with all the buildings looking all but identical, we will be able to construct new factories for arms and goods, infrastructure and dwellings much faster."
      anc_industry_6:0 "Even More Scientists"
      anc_industry_6_desc:0 "History will show we were more than right to move from the words and ramblings of wisemen and techno-prophets to the research and experiments of the scientist. In its short lifetime the [root.GetName] Science Corps has pushed the boundaries of our understanding forwards by decades. If our small and relatively underfunded teams can do so much with so little, it must be wondered what they can achieve if more resources are directed their way and if more scientists were recruited."
    ### WASTELAND INDUSTRY ###
      anc_wasteland_industry_0:0 "Wasteland Scavenging"
      anc_wasteland_industry_0_desc:0 "The wastelands are a cruel place, where storms can flay a man alive or grind exposed rockcrete into dust. Not to mention the roving bands of techno-barbarians who give homage to no nation, or the horrible things left over from before Old Night. Yet it is also a bountiful place, where many a stockpile or abandoned cache can be found. \n \n Our people have been going out on unofficial and unsanctioned expeditions into some of the tamer parts of the waste since before anyone can recall. It may be the right time to launch our own scavenging missions into the wilder, more deadly parts of the wasteland. This will alleviate many of the costs that come with building an army but may have unforeseen, and certainly dangerous consequences for our scavenging teams."
      anc_wasteland_industry_1:0 "Rebuild Old Roads"
      anc_wasteland_industry_1_desc:0 "Even after the ravaging of Old Night the roads built by our ancestors millennia ago remain. Thousands of kilometres of highway and rockcrete roads crisscross our lands, creating a golden opportunity for expanding our presence across territories that nominally belong to us. However, these roads have been neglected and few remain in any sort of usable state. \n \n Therefore, and also due to our limited resources, our repair efforts will be greatly reduced and it is unlikely our roads will ever become even tangentially similar to roads before Old Night."
      anc_wasteland_industry_2:0 "Expand the Infrastructure"
      anc_wasteland_industry_2_desc:0 "We have repaired what we could but unfortunately, we have fallen before our goal of reconnecting our realm. The roads of Old Terra are not enough as new settlements have sprung up since Old Night far from the reaches of the great highways. As such, new roads must be built. \n \n Huge workforces have been gathered, tithed from the towns and cities that our new roads will be connecting. The useless roads, too damaged or too isolated to be useful have been broken down for materials. This will be a significant undertaking, but we shall succeed."
      anc_wasteland_industry_3:0 "Connect Remote Villages"
      anc_wasteland_industry_3_desc:0 "Within our territory lie hundreds of separate and remote communities, many so distant and off the radblasted path that they have not made contact with outsiders in generations. \n \n  An effort should be made to connect and reclaim these villages, for not only will this establish our control in areas where our influence may be waning but it will also create a new wave of recruits, both volunteers and conscripts, that our recruiters and press-gangs were unable to reach before."
      anc_wasteland_industry_4:0 "Wasteland Growth"
      anc_wasteland_industry_4_desc:0 "Much of our territory is ours by technicality only, with perhaps a few communities and outposts scattered across hundreds of kilometers of wasteland. \n \n To secure these vast tracts of land and also expand our population, we should set up frontier settlements and townships. To populate them, incentives and forceful migration will be used in equal measure. The predicted population growth should make the whole exercise worth it."
      anc_wasteland_industry_5:0 "Improving Our Home"
      anc_wasteland_industry_5_desc:0 "Our capital city, the gem of our realm, has changed little in the years since we took stewardship of it from its previous rulers. Perhaps it is time for a little bit of an upgrade. Surrounding the outer limits of our capital lie the ruins of the old world, thousands upon thousands of burnt out factorums and habitats, ravaged by war and the rad-blasted environment to the point of being useless to us even just as shelter. \n \n However, by sending out hundreds of scavenger teams into these outskirts, equipped with blowtorches and basic survival equipment, we may bring the precious metals and other materials that make up these ruins back into our city to help with its expansion."
      anc_wasteland_industry_6:0 "Wasteland Manufactorums"
      anc_wasteland_industry_6_desc:0 "Outside of our walls lies the great abyss that is the wasteland. Within our walls our people suffer, starved of everything but the bare necessities for survival. And our walls lie in ruin, our current industrial base incapable of returning them to their former glory. However, the first of these three problems may offer the solution to the latter two. \n \n Out in the wasteland we will construct huge and sprawling manufactorums, capable of producing not just some of the equipment and materials needed for our construction projects but also a truly mind-boggling amount of amenities and even, by the Gods, actual luxury items."
      anc_wasteland_industry_7:0 "Wasteland Armoriums"
      anc_wasteland_industry_7_desc:0 "Our armies need weapons, and to build weapons we need factorums. With the expansion of our lines of communication and transport the wasteland has suddenly become prime real estate on which we can build said manufactorums. \n \n These shall be colossal conurbations, practically towns in their own right into which shall be fed all the resources our miners and scavengers can gather. Within, ceramite, plasteel and adamantium shall become lasguns, power armour and Baneblade."
    ### RESOURCE PROSPECTING ###
      anc_resource_prospecting_0:0 "Resource Prospecting"
      anc_resource_prospecting_0_desc:0 "Though Terra has been long thought stripped of all resources, our surveyors have confirmed quite the opposite. Terra still has much in its bounty, we simply lack the means to reach it. \n \n Excavation and mining techniques, both new and old, must be employed if we are to claim these riches."
      anc_resource_prospecting_1:0 "Ceramite Furnaces"
      anc_resource_prospecting_1_desc:0 "Ceramite is a ceramic that is widely-used in our military production as it is both shock- and heat-resistant. However, this latter quality while a great boon also creates an issue. Our furnaces are not hot enough to really affect ceramite in a meaningful or effective way. \n \n Research efforts will be launched into finding new techniques and fuels that may help expedite our ceramite production."
      anc_resource_prospecting_2:0 "Promethium Pipelines"
      anc_resource_prospecting_2_desc:0 "The lifeblood of Empire. Promethium is the fuel that keeps our vehicles running, the thing we burn to keep our halls warm and the ammunition for flame weaponry. There is likely no other resource that is more valuable than this liquid gold. Yet for now, we lack the means to properly move our reserves across our lands. \n \n As such, new pipelines shall be placed, thousands of kilometers of plasteel piping shall run across our territory like arteries and veins, and like a circulatory system the blood of industry will be pumped across the body of our nation."
      anc_resource_prospecting_3:0 "Plasteel Forges"
      anc_resource_prospecting_3_desc:0 "As our military gathers and our soldiers are armed our lack of plasteel has been exposed. This ancient alloy, created long before Old Night is just as strong as steel, yet as flexible as plastic which has made it perfect for use in building all types of military equipment. \n \n We must learn the old ways of plasteel synthesising, and from there create great forges from which to supply our armies with guns, bullets and body armour. "
      anc_resource_prospecting_4:0 "Adamantium Mines"
      anc_resource_prospecting_4_desc:0 "Stronger than plasteel, stronger than ceramite, adamantium is unbeaten in the realm of sturdiness. This has made it a valued commodity for our military in the construction of heavy tanks and the like. As such, it is imperative we dig up all we can from Terra’s blighted soil. \n \n Wherever a deposit is found a vast mine shall be built, manned by local miners looking for a living as well as penal-slaves, working away lifetime sentences in the dark."
    ### HIVE CITY INDUSTRY ###
      anc_hive_industry_0:0 "Hive City Scavenging"
      anc_hive_industry_0_desc:0 "The Hives of our territory are ancient things that have endured millenia of chaos and war and yet still remain. So gargantuan are these edificies, rivalling the largest natural mountains on Terra, that it has been centuries since we have properly surveyed anything more than the civilised regions of our Hives. \n \n There is much within the depths of these bastions we have yet to discover, be it caches of valuable resources or lost communities, ready to be conscripted into our armies."
      anc_hive_industry_1:0 "Children Guarantee Retirement"
      anc_hive_industry_1_desc:0 "A Hive’s primary resource, no matter how many manufactorums or replictators dot their surface, will always be manpower. Some have likened these mountains of steel to mines in fact, where instead of ore an almost infinite supply of workers and soldiers are taken by press gangs and capture-automaton. \n \n However, excessive tithing of the population is unsustainable, and so policies that will ensure a long term source of manpower must be introduced. Children Guarantee Retirement. (Retirement clause only triggered after a total of 350,400 working hours registered.)"
      anc_hive_industry_2:0 "Hive City Manufactorums"
      anc_hive_industry_2_desc:0 "While our initial plans involved shipping the vast majority of conscripted workers outside of the Hives to work in manufactorum complexes across our lands, it has become increasingly clear that more local production facilities will be required. \n \n As such, it seems only logical that we begin construction of manufactorums within our Hive Cities to augment the handful of manufactorums that are already present. Naturally a small amount of urban ‘restructuring’ will be required however this surplus of unemployed vagabonds will be perfect for manning these new facilities."
      anc_hive_industry_3:0 "Local Goods Production"
      anc_hive_industry_3_desc:0 "A Hive requires a warlord's ransom in terms of resources in order to keep the population alive and, if not happy, servile. Previously, vast trade and supply networks have supplied this demand, however, there are fears such convoys could be compromised in times of war as starving a population centre is often considered much easier than actually conquering it. \n \n As such, local production systems will need to be put in place to help sustain a portion, if not all, of our Hive’s needs."
      anc_hive_industry_4:0 "Hive Construction Program"
      anc_hive_industry_4_desc:0 "A Hive has a capacity of millions and can be filled by millions more on top of that, but despite this, there comes a time when a Hive needs to grow. Usually this happens naturally, with new spires and manufactorums being built on the outskirts, slums then rising up around them and then growing, higher and higher until ultimately the area becomes indistinguishable from the rest of the Hive. \n \n However, in order to sustain our growing needs the Hives must be expanded. Now."
      anc_hive_industry_5:0 "Hive Armoriums"
      anc_hive_industry_5_desc:0 "Our armies need guns, they need body armour and they need tanks. Our Hives will provide. The vast workforces of our Hives shall be put to work in even vaster armoriums and weapons manufactorums. In times of siege or in times of peace these weapon’s factorums shall produce thousands of war materials, protected by the walls of the Hive."
      anc_hive_industry_6:0 "Resource Requisition"
      anc_hive_industry_6_desc:0 "As has been previously stated, a Hive is home to vast amounts of resources just waiting to be used. Previous efforts in this area have been middling at best, with caches often being misreported or simply concealed from us by corrupt officials to be sold away to line their own pockets. Now however, as our logistics corps have evolved to the point that such corruption is much harder to hide, we shall begin the process of ‘requisitioning’ these stolen resources from these traitors to our nation."
      anc_hive_industry_7:0 "Protecting the Hive"
      anc_hive_industry_7_desc:0 "A Hive is more than just a sprawling city, it is also a near impenetrable fortress. Even in their currently unfortified state, our Hives are labyrinths of unplanned and unregulated urban development, equal to any architect’s "perfect" fortress. However, a few added fortifications wouldn’t hurt as it may very well become possible that, in times of most dire invasion, we may fall back to the Hives as last bastions. In such a circumstance we cannot afford for our protections to be found wanting."

  ### Politics Focuses ###
  ########################

    anc_politics_0:0 "Political Effort"
    anc_politics_0_desc:0 "To some, the domination of [ROOT.GetLeader] over our nation has grown stale, and voices within our borders have begun to whisper for change..."

    ### ANCIENT ###
    ## INDIVIDUALIST ##
      ancient_indi_0:0 "A Road Walked Alone"
      ancient_indi_0_desc:0 "We look at our past, we look at our future and determine that to be together as one nation and survive. We must walk alone, a path travelled by many ancestors for time and time before. Join hands and walk along our lone path and together we will weather any storm that comes our way of steel or sand."

      ancient_indi_1:0 "One Nation We Stand"
      ancient_indi_1_desc:0 "To stand the test of time we must unite as one nation. We might have borders but those borders are pointless without a people to stand behind them. Rally the people of our home and bring them together in unity to stand."

      ancient_indi_2:0 "Defend The Home Borders"
      ancient_indi_2_desc:0 "To determine a position of power and be able to take on our foes who certainly exist and wish to take over our proud nation, we will certainly need to ensure that we can properly defend our own borders. A place to give our people some power and draw together an instinct for survival."

      ancient_indi_3:0 "A Nation Endures"
      ancient_indi_3_desc:0 "We have determined our path, a future of a nation undivided protecting their homes with their lives. We will endure and we will survive with the strength of our ancestors. Perfecting a tradition of mutual support within out own homes and families will set us up with determination that no foe can crush regardless of their willpower."

      ancient_indi_4:0 "An Industrial Heritage"
      ancient_indi_4_desc:0 "It may be countless years between us the and the ancestors we look to for guidance but regardless of how many millenia pass, our race is always a resourceful one and is no different with our people. We must secure an industrial front should we believe we can secure a military front for our borders."

      ancient_indi_5:0 "A Thinking Man's Home"
      ancient_indi_5_desc:0 "A foundation in industry is established but following a past trend will only get us so far. We must grasp with both hands the lessons of the past and take steps forward into the future and carve the path ourselves, for that we need to allow for thought. We must make our nation a thinking persons home."

      ancient_indi_6:0 "Develop The Future"
      ancient_indi_6_desc:0 "We may have developed a knack for our people to provide technological change but there is only so much we can do with our current set of tools and equipment. We must invest in the ability to expand on our research into the very technology that will provide us our future!"

      ancient_indi_7:0 "Provide For Ourselves"
      ancient_indi_7_desc:0 "If we are to provide ourselves with a reliable resource deposit for our future endevours and what we wish to achieve with our industrial ability we must ensure that no other nation is a drain on our ability to produce. Self sustinance is the avenue of travel."

      ancient_indi_8:0 "A Developed Reliance"
      ancient_indi_8_desc:0 "We have dug to the depths of our homes to provide ourselves with plasteel but we must seek more material to sustain development. A variety of materials is more useful to the endevours of our nation and will provide our thinking people flexibility to create new technology."

      ancient_indi_9:0 "A Technological Allowance"
      ancient_indi_9_desc:0 "Raw materials are rolling in, it is time to marry those materials with the minds of our greatest thinkers and provide them with platforms to develop from. With stepping stones of old tech paving a start point for our great nation we can spring from these and bring a new development in the arms our people bear to defend their home and the lives they live."

    ## COLLECTIVIST ##

      ancient_coll_0:0 "A Race Connected"
      ancient_coll_0_desc:0 "We can learn a lot from history, our ancestors learnt that a race connected, a people brought together to share knowledge, wealth and a home is a people who better set themselves up for the future as any wise person will acknowledge the need for help and support at one point in their existence."

      ancient_coll_1:0 "A Connection That Grows"
      ancient_coll_1_desc:0 "We must nurture our connection, in a hurt world and a damaged cold place we must be careful to show strength in a combined people, linking arms with those neighbouring us not only in location but ideals. We were not the only people that can draw traces back to ancient origins and surely we must all understand this?"

      ancient_coll_2:0 "A Kindling In Hearts"
      ancient_coll_2_desc:0 "An ember burns in the heart of all of us, melt the cold away and let us kindle that ember into a roaring fire of hope and destiny. A destiny shaped by our actions and by sharing it with one another."

      ancient_coll_3:0 "An Offer Extended"
      ancient_coll_3_desc:0 "We offer out support and help to those nearest, other people may wage war around this planet but we can offer a branch out to those around us and help one another secure our borders from those afar that wish to take our homes from us. It may be a gamble but should it pay off we could see the beginning of the future!"

      ancient_coll_4:0 "An Intelligent Industry"
      ancient_coll_4_desc:0 "An industry must work smarter not harder, we can start this by providing an efficient flow for the workers and people of our nations. Taking care of our needs in an intelligent manner opens up the resources available to developed thinking and changed technology."

      ancient_coll_5:0 "Knowledge Is Wealth"
      ancient_coll_5_desc:0 "It is said that knowledge is power and in this case, holding knowledge provides us a great wealth, the ability to develop a future, that future could be securing our home with better arms or securing or people with better lives. This is a wealth we must procure!"

      ancient_coll_6:0 "Knowledge Shared Is Wealth Gained"
      ancient_coll_6_desc:0 "What better way to gain a valuable portion of knowledge than to share ideals and collect the great minds of our combined nations and pool this power, this wealth for all to see and benefit from."

      ancient_coll_7:0 "Together We Stand"
      ancient_coll_7_desc:0 "To defend our borders we must be willing to take arms and wage war, a decision not made lightly but if we want to be taken seriously and we want to be a nation that exists beyond the end of this year. It must be done."

      ancient_coll_8:0 "Home Beyond Borders"
      ancient_coll_8_desc:0 "A war often waged in the guise of providing homes, but we can take these opportunities to expand the wealth of people at our disposal and create not homes for our people but create new people for our homes. We must cross our borders if we wish to defend them, for expanding into the beyond better prepares us for what we may face."

      ancient_coll_9:0 "Into The Fold"
      ancient_coll_9_desc:0 "We conquer new lands, we find new people and those people must understand that they contribute to a collective. A new nation of people that they now belong to and with that comes becoming part of our fold, our lives and they must not fear their new neighbours and occupiers but see this as an opportunity to thrive!"

    ### RUINOUS ###
      anc_ruinous_0:0 "Dark Promises"
      anc_ruinous_0_desc:0 "Strangers have come to our lands in recent days, telling of a new Pantheon that has been embraced by many in the northern tribes. They do not have a name, but the gifts they offer mean that many within our own nation are beginning to listen to the sermons these strangers give."
      anc_ruinous_1:0 "§RAnger§!"
      anc_ruinous_1_desc:0 "The God we align ourselves with most when we listen to the sermons is a Warrior-God. He seems to be an angry deity, and His gifts induce a fraction of His anger in our warriors. This turns them into whirlwinds of death when they charge the enemy. An effective tactic for sure when the goal is simple slaughter, though much less helpful when it comes to having our warriors survive said charges, as it seems their self-preservation urges are overwhelmed. However, the berserker strength these warriors seem to gain when they fight may just make up for the losses these attacks incur."
      anc_ruinous_2:0 "§RRage§!"
      anc_ruinous_2_desc:0 "The next step on the Warrior-God's path is rage. While all of our warriors can embrace the Warrior-God's anger, only some are strong enough to carry His rage within them. This righteous rage shall become the defining trait of our people when it comes to dealing with outsiders."
      anc_ruinous_3:0 "§RHatred§!"
      anc_ruinous_3_desc:0 "The final thing the sermons of the strangers have taught us is that hatred of our enemies is key to honouring the Warrior-God. Already those warriors who have taken His hatred into their hearts have become even greater exemplars of war than we previously believed possible for mortal men."
      anc_ruinous_4:0 "§GDecay§!"
      anc_ruinous_4_desc:0 "The God we align ourselves with most when we listen to the sermons is a God of Life, but also Death. His worshippers are unusually hardy on the field of battle and His blessings have led to good harvests that we can use to fuel our people and (in these times maybe even more importantly) our armies."
      anc_ruinous_5:0 "§GDespair§!"
      anc_ruinous_5_desc:0 "A favoured tactic of the warriors that follow the God of Life and Death is the use of terror to break our enemies. Simple things from desecrating our enemy's dead on the field to be found by their fellows, to the more complex incorporation of depictions of the dead and other such symbols into our defensive emplacements, have gone a long way to demoralising our opponents."
      anc_ruinous_6:0 "§GDisease§!"
      anc_ruinous_6_desc:0 "The final strategy taught by the strangers' sermons is that biological warfare can be an impressive tool when used carefully and correctly. Catapulting corpses into besieged settlements, bloated with diseases unseen by any mortal until gifted to us by our God, poisoning wells to deny our enemies access to water, and sustaining ourselves on things so rotten and spoiled that only our hardy warriors can bear them, have all been suggested by the servants of the God of Life and Death. These ideas have all been added to the doctrines of our nation's armies."
      anc_ruinous_7:0 "§PDecadence§!"
      anc_ruinous_7_desc:0 "The God we align ourselves with most when we listen to the sermons is a God of Decadence and Extremes. Those who follow Its path pledge themselves to such a life of extremes. This has led to some becoming warriors of great skill and pride, their creed being the pursuit of perfection in their chosen art. However, these individuals are well known within our ranks for their 'eccentricities'."
      anc_ruinous_8:0 "§PPleasure§!"
      anc_ruinous_8_desc:0 "To those who serve the God of Decadence, pleasure has become another great goal. With the growing worship of this God throughout our lands, there is perhaps an opportunity to be found here. Through a combination of increased wages in the army and the turning of a blind eye to the more extreme acts of sadism these cultists enjoy, we can make them much more willing to fight. This increase in morale will probably not encourage any new volunteers, but it might push our current crop of soldiers just that bit further."
      anc_ruinous_9:0 "§PExcess§!"
      anc_ruinous_9_desc:0 "The final thing that the strangers have preached is the necessity for Excess when one follows the God of Decadence. Until now, we have been forced to keep this practice in check, as our previous industrial capabilities had made rationing and a need-based system a requirement. However, with our nation's growth, it has become possible to finally obey this final teaching. The worshippers of the God of Decadence have made their pleasure on this known, but will require copious amounts of stimulants and other such substances before committing to a battle."
      anc_ruinous_10:0 "§BChange§!"
      anc_ruinous_10_desc:0 "The God we align ourselves with most when we listen to the sermons is a Raven-God, and he is the patron of sorcery and change. His followers are cunning and what they lack in combat-ability, they make up for in intelligence gathering and spywork. They will likely be invaluable to the defence of our people until our forces can surpass our neighbour’s armies."
      anc_ruinous_11:0 "§BFate§!"
      anc_ruinous_11_desc:0 "The worship of this Raven-God is one not suited to natural warriors, for war is not the primary place the boons of his patronage can be seen. His flock has gathered a substantial part of our intelligentsia, at least those that are left. It has been noted their work has been greatly enhanced by strange visions and flashes of insight, granted by the Raven-God. Perhaps our research efforts as a whole can be assisted by encouraging his worship within our labs.  "
      anc_ruinous_12:0 "§BDeceit§!"
      anc_ruinous_12_desc:0 "The final teaching of the strangers, when they speak of the Raven-God, is that all war is based on deception. We shall mask our plans under shrouds of lies, we shall deceive even our own people as to our goals and methods. When the knife strikes from the dark and our armies materialise at their gates, they shall be unprepared and unready to oppose us. In this way we shall incorporate this teaching into our war-making."
      anc_ruinous_13:0 "Dark Apostles"
      anc_ruinous_13_desc:0 "The most devoted in our ranks have been blessed by Our God. These chosen few have become their Dark Apostles. \n \n In a callback to the Prophets of Terra's religions of old, they will command our hosts as leaders, both in religion and war. They shall enslave the blind fools who still deny the Gods, they shall preside over the grand sacrifices we commit to the Gods. They shall be the vanguard when the time comes to march from our lands."

  ### Military Focuses ###

    anc_military_0:0 "Military Effort"
    anc_military_0_desc:0 "Perhaps during the latter years of the Old Night our current war making capabilities could have been considered adequate. However, in this new time we find ourselves in, where Terra’s bounty has been thoroughly ransacked and our designs and tactics are centuries out of date, we must take it upon ourselves to overhaul all aspects of our military."
    ### ARMY ###
      anc_army_0:0 "Reforming the Army"
      anc_army_0_desc:0 "Our army is an ancient organisation, perhaps even older than our very nation. It is shocking then to learn that in the millennia since its founding remarkably little has changed within its ranks. A constantly shifting roundabout of cliques have maintained their influence over our soldiers, stifling any intrusion into their politics through near treasonous obstructionism. \n \n This has distanced the army from us by dividing its loyalties. Reforming the military by breaking up these cliques will go a long way in bringing the armed forces back under our direct control."
      # Doctrine #
        anc_doctrine_0:0 "Basic Drills"
        anc_doctrine_0_desc:0 "With the new reforms taking effect across the width and breadth of our ground forces, the attention of the newest generation of experienced commanders has shifted towards training the common soldier. For years, the army has been allowed to stagnate due to both the relative calm in recent times and the neglect of their former leaders. \n \n To counter this, a new mandate of constant drilling has been issued. Squad, tactical and strategic operations will be practiced until they are considered fit for the worst Terra has to offer."
        anc_doctrine_1:0 "Focus on Offence"
        anc_doctrine_1_desc:0 "Terra is a wasteland, with very few areas really worth, or even capable of, being held for an extended period of time. Strategists within the army and civilian analysts studying our urban sectors have all agreed, holding land that is little more than irradiated desert is a tactic doomed for failure. \n \n Instead, seizing more territory will open up the scarce resources of the waste to us where a defensive doctrine would see us starved. Our battlefield philosophy should reflect this. Focus will be placed on a constant push forward, holding only long enough to reorganise and resupply for the next assault."
        anc_doctrine_2:0 "Eternal Warfare"
        anc_doctrine_2_desc:0 "Peace was never an option. This lesson has been taught to us a thousand times, over the course of thousands of years. Skirmishes, raids and full fledged battles on our borders are not an uncommon thing in the slightest and have shown us that war is an eternal factor in human existence. \n \n It is for this reason we should always be ready to fight. For if we aren’t we may be caught dangerously off guard."
        anc_doctrine_3:0 "Trench Sweeping"
        anc_doctrine_3_desc:0 "The trench is the universal defensive technique, even the ancient Legio of Ru’oma used the trench when encamping on the eve of battle. The genius minds of the Dark Age of Technology however, saw the trench eliminated from the doctrines of Humanity’s armies, rendered obsolete by ever more effective weapons. \n \n  Alas, in our modern times the trench is once more a formidable opponent and our armies will need to be trained to counter them. Some units will use grenades, others shotguns and others still will use far more arcane and unique methods, but all in our army must know how to overcome the humble trench."
        anc_doctrine_4:0 "Formalized Doctrines"
        anc_doctrine_4_desc:0 "Now that the focus of our army’s training has been established, we may once again study how to use our soldiers on the battlefield. Despite our best efforts previously, our strategic command is still lacking in experience when it comes to the art of war and so our theorists must continue to expand our understanding of it. \n \n By studying conflicts abroad and the performance of our own armies, High Command should be able to devise a new formalized system within which our army may operate while on the field."
        anc_doctrine_5:0 "The New Routine"
        anc_doctrine_5_desc:0 "It is clear to see that our officer corps is one of the more skilled on Terra. However, this is not to say improvements cannot be made. It has become standard practice for our commanders to both self-evaluate and review the work of their comrades in reports. \n \n While previously, such reports tended to be little more than pieces of propaganda, it has now become routine for them to be much more formal in nature, with more flamboyant reports being created by our information services to show the people. These new reports emphasise enemies killed, casualties taken and objectives achieved, with personal accolades taking a backseat."
        anc_doctrine_6:0 "Focus on Defence"
        anc_doctrine_6_desc:0 "Terra is a hellscape, so why should we march out into its wastes? Our armies will fortify wherever they encamp, they shall hold the line wherever they are commanded to, they shall defend any hill should their Generals order it. Most of the wasteland is useless to us, however, there are areas of abundance, rare beacons of wealth such as mines not yet stripped bare or Hive cities brimming with people and archeotech just waiting to be bent to our will. \n \n So we shall train our soldiers in the art of defence so that none may breach our borders."
        anc_doctrine_7:0 "Ideological Defence"
        anc_doctrine_7_desc:0 "The best defence is one that never needs to be tested in the first place. Through a convoluted mix of diplomatic manipulations and careful spread of our institutions and our beliefs throughout our neighbours, we will discourage military action against us. By tying our ideologies to potential aggressors, conflict may be resolved peacefully, reducing the risk of war breaking out. This will likely not stop a determined invader, but it will certainly give us more time to prepare our defences."
        anc_doctrine_8:0 "Efficient Trench Systems"
        anc_doctrine_8_desc:0 "The trench is the universal defensive technique, even the ancient Legio of Ru’oma used the trench when encamping on the eve of battle. The genius minds of the Dark Age of Technology however, saw the trench eliminated from the doctrines of Humanity’s armies, rendered obsolete by ever more effective weapons. \n \n However in these times the trench may once again become our quintessential defensive option. It is much easier, much faster and most importantly much cheaper to build a trench than a full rockcrete pillbox, with a negligible, or even non-existent loss in defensive integrity depending on the situation."
      # Misc Military #
        anc_army_1:0 "New Recruits"
        anc_army_1_desc:0 "War is a meat grinder, and our armies have begun to feel the strain of our manpower limits due to both our reforms and casualties taken on the field. A solution has been found in the form of a new draft that will be rolled out across our nation. \n \n This draft will involve both volunteer quotas and conscription of dangerous elements of society, creating a useful corps of new recruits ready to either be folded into depleted units or to make up entirely new formations depending on our needs."
        anc_army_2:0 "Squash the Resistance"
        anc_army_2_desc:0 "Our army has not, at least in its current iteration, carried out garrison duty over a hostile population. This has led to a degradation in its ability to deal with insurgent forces. By rolling out new training regimes for garrison units we can bring our army back up to scratch in regard to counter-insurgency operations. \n \n This will involve military operations to clear out rebel strongholds but also training in re-education operations. The culture of conquered regions will often need to be forcibly repressed through both a reformed education system and a network of workcamps, where strict adherence to the culture of [Root.GetName] will be instilled."
      # Army #
        anc_army_3:0 "Army Scientists"
        anc_army_3_desc:0 "For too long our scientific pursuits have been limited by the whims of half-mad or completely mad wisemen and pseudo-prophets. Suffice it to say this has not lent itself to an advanced military machine. Therefore, a new scientific branch of the army will need to be created in order to facilitate a swift retooling of our army. \n \n Unfortunately, time has not been kind to most of the educational institutions of Terra, so this new group will be largely made up of the more sane and useful of the savants and self-proclaimed men of knowledge, even though we would have preferred true scientists of an educated nature."
        anc_army_4:0 "Focus on Vehicles"
        anc_army_4_desc:0 "The last few millennia have been the time of armies of infantrymen fighting each other, largely unsupported by vehicles, in the mud. Finally however, we have the resources and the know-how to expand into the realm of armoured force, a concept hitherto rendered impractical by a lack of capable engineers. We shall study basic vehicles taken from mercenary warbands or left behind following battles between more advanced nations and use the insight gained to hurry along work on our own, albeit primitive, designs."
        anc_army_5:0 "Cheaper Vehicles"
        anc_army_5_desc:0 "A vehicle is a rather expensive piece of equipment and as development continues and new models are rediscovered this will likely only become more true. As such our designers should work to optimise the cost-to-efficiency ratio of our vehicles. \n \n Unfortunately, this will see many redundancies and backup systems removed which will make our vehicles more liable to break down between operations, but the lower production costs should mean for every tank or truck we lose to a drive failure we will have one to replace it."
        anc_army_6:0 "Improved Vehicles"
        anc_army_6_desc:0 "A vehicle is a rather expensive piece of equipment so we should prioritize keeping our fleet operational once deployed. Previously our scavenged and rag-tag vehicles bore little in the way of standardised or replaceable components, with each being effectively artisan-made and unique. \n \n Now, refits will be carried out to create an improved and uniform force that when deployed will not be disabled rattling upthe first hill they see or knocked out by a stray cannon shell."
        anc_army_7:0 "Mechanical Mounts"
        anc_army_7_desc:0 "For thousands of years before the invention of the motor, and for centuries after the fact, the main method of transporting troops and equipment to and from battles was the horse. For millennia since Old Night we were forced to return to this archaic practice but finally we may begin to mechanise our forces once again. \n \n A new focus will be placed on rediscovering lost transport designs so that we may soon translate from organic mounts for our infantry to more mechanised methods of assault."
        anc_army_8:0 "Better Motors"
        anc_army_8_desc:0 "Engineers have struggled since the beginning of Old Night to maintain our ability to make engines. The fact they were able to achieve this is a matter of great celebration as now with our industry returning to a civilised standard we may reintroduce these superior engines and motors back into active production."
        anc_army_9:0 "Potent Fuels"
        anc_army_9_desc:0 "Our current refining methods are, in a word, inefficient. By introducing new techniques and scrutinising our refineries much more harshly we should be able to stretch Terra’s limited supply of promethium a little further than we previously thought possible."
        anc_army_10:0 "Ramming Speed"
        anc_army_10_desc:0 "Despite our improved industry we have been unable to produce enough ammunition for many of our tank models. As such a more primitive solution has been decided upon as a stopgap: Spikes. \n \n Some may question the logic of sticking enough spikes on a tank to make a Stegosaurus jealous, they may also call it barbaric or pointlessly wasteful. We say they haven't seen the spectacle of a 60-tonne metal box covered in 10 centimetre thick armour and protrusions sharp enough to skewer a Thunder Warrior slamming into a crowd of stunned enemies."
        anc_army_11:0 "Sturdier Frames"
        anc_army_11_desc:0 "A tank is not just a glorified weapons carrier, and our advances in armour finally represent this. The lost techniques of shock-absorbing armour and sensor-based suspension will keep the crews of our vehicles alive much longer."
        anc_army_12:0 "Focus on Infantry"
        anc_army_12_desc:0 "The core of our army is the humble infantryman. A soldier armed with only a stubber, or if they are lucky an autogun or even a lasgun. No matter our advances in armoured force or aircraft, it will always fall to the soldier to take and hold a building, to defend or clear a trench. \n \n As such it would be foolish of us not to focus on what has been the centre of our army for millennia. We shall start by looking to upgrade the equipment they are given."
        anc_army_13:0 "Cheap Weapons"
        anc_army_13_desc:0 "A gun is a gun. A piece of body armour is a piece of body armour. While we could work to upgrade the weapons we give our troops, we should at least ensure all of our troops are equipped first, even if it limits the overall quality of our weaponry. Our limited industry makes this a significant challenge for us to overcome, however by streamlining our production lines and cheaper components we should be able to get a weapon into the hands of every soldier."
        anc_army_14:0 "High-Quality Gear"
        anc_army_14_desc:0 "We cannot afford to constantly create new autoguns or body armour every time some grunt leaves theirs in a muddy ditch for too long. Therefore, in the interests of preserving industrial capital, we must look to creating sturdier weaponry. This will be relatively easy and will not require a new model of weapon to be created. \n \n Simple upgrades such as superior casings, air-tight welding and even remedial training on weapons handling will go a very long way to preserving our weapons on the field."
        anc_army_15:0 "Improved Standard Training"
        anc_army_15_desc:0 "What we lack in technology and quality of arms we shall make up for in discipline and training. Our soldiers should be able to march a score kilometers fully equipped under the baking sun or in freezing rad-winter, all without rest or a break in formation. They should be able to break our enemies on the field, with both unfearing determination and efficiency, no matter the cost in lives. \n \n This training will be harsh, but it will be needed to bridge the gap between human ability and scientific advancement."
        anc_army_16:0 "Enhanced Cybernetics"
        anc_army_16_desc:0 "The human body is frail, this is a fact we have come to learn and accept. To overcome these limits, our armies must become something more than what we once were. \n \n They shall be given cybernetics, from designs gleaned from the ruins of the Old Night, that shall make their endurance legendary. They shall run three score miles daily, they shall not tire and they shall not be weakened by cold or heat. Unfortunately this will do little to improve their abilities in combat, but the added mobility on a strategic level will be hugely beneficial."
        anc_army_17:0 "Integrated Support Companies"
        anc_army_17_desc:0 "Our units are not just hordes of brutes carrying only their autoguns and a few rounds, at least most of them aren’t. A military formation is a logistical equation, with support companies being an often debilitatingly complex, yet completely necessary addition. \n \n By integrating these companies far deeper into our armies, merging ranks and training individuals to serve both as basic infantrymen and as specialists, they will become much more orderly outfits."
        anc_army_18:0 "Expand Drill Sergeant Corps"
        anc_army_18_desc:0 "At this point in time our Drill Sergeant Corps is an unofficial organisation at best. Rolled into the jurisdiction of individual training grounds, creating a varied level of competency and experience. Some Sergeants are even greener than the men they are training! \n \n The time has come to form an actual unit for Drill Sergeants, made up of discharged veterans, volunteers from the army and contractors. This unit will take all elements of drill training under their auspices, creating a new baseline our soldiers will be trained to."
        anc_army_19:0 "Tighter Ranks"
        anc_army_19_desc:0 "Tighter ranks may seem like a directive motivated merely by cosmetics and visual appeal. This is not entirely accurate, as it in fact involves far more than just reducing the space between marching soldiers. This program will teach the men and women of our army to be one when fighting on the field, to become a force capable of knocking aside any enemy with the force of their will. \n \n To do this, individuality must be beaten out of the men, we cannot afford free-thinkers or lone wolves in a life or death situation where the orders of commanders must be followed to the letter. "
        anc_army_20:0 "Expanded Special Forces Program"
        anc_army_20_desc:0 "Our Special Forces have been falling behind in recent years, with most of our propaganda and recruitment incentives being focused on the larger standard military. With the need for elite troops on the frontline surging once more it is time to rectify this and a new recruitment drive shall be launched centred around the special forces.. \n \n By expanding the support and command structure for our special forces we can make space for the new swell of the most capable volunteers who would have normally joined the standard regiments."
        anc_army_21:0 "More Lenient Requirements"
        anc_army_21_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts the special forces have not become the frontline units we were hoping for. Instead, their limited manpower pool has seen them trapped in a limbo between being a supplementary force and being a branch of the army in their own right. \n \n In order to further expand the special forces the requirements for joining up will be made closer to the level we expect of the common soldier. Remedial training should help make up for the deficit in skill this will create."
    ### AIRFORCE ###
      anc_airforce_0:0 "Theory of Flight"
      anc_airforce_0_desc:0 "Flight is an interesting concept. We have air capable vehicles, we have the ability to build a collection of mishmash models that generally perform most of the roles expected of a fighter plane, but we do not know how they actually work. The secret of flight has been effectively lost to us for centuries. However, new advancements in other fields along with an increased understanding of the engineering behind our current air force will finally enable us to begin modifying our current designs and maybe even introduce new standardized models of aircraft, an idea unthought of until now by our military command."
      anc_airforce_1:0 "Airports"
      anc_airforce_1_desc:0 "In order to access this new theatre of war, bases specifically for use by our air force must be constructed. Theorists and logisticians predicted such a thing would be unnecessary, that the flatlands of our territory would be more than suitable for aircraft to operate from. Such a naive assessment has been quickly disproved, not only does uneven or soft ground often make take off and landing dangerous, it has also been shown that shelter beyond tarpaulin will be needed for long term operations. \n \n We shall start by building a smaller airport from which we can keep our current air force ready to go at any moment should they be needed."
      anc_airforce_2:0 "Age of Strife Planes"
      anc_airforce_2_desc:0 "Our air force is in great need of planes. \n \n Our industry should be able to eventually solve this deficit, however, a much cheaper and quicker solution has revealed itself. Throughout our lands ancient and broken air vehicles lay scattered, concealed by the passage of time. We have the ability to restore many of these craft to working order and the only reason we have not done so yet is due to a lack of effort in locating them. A concerted attempt by both hired scavengers and elements of our army to retrieve these wrecks will enable us to expand our current air fleet."
      anc_airforce_3:0 "Early Doctrines"
      anc_airforce_3_desc:0 "Our people do not have any experience when it comes to flying so we have quickly run into the issue of how to fight an air war. Thankfully, a few former pilots and veterans from other states have come to live within our borders for a variety of reasons and these individuals do have an understanding of basic air strategy. We can hire or at the very least retain them and put their collective knowledge towards putting together a methodology of war in the sky. \n \n From there, we must look towards what role our air force will take when it comes to our wider military machine."
      anc_airforce_4:0 "Basic Fighters"
      anc_airforce_4_desc:0 "When one thinks of an aircraft, the first thing to come to mind is the nimble fighter, purpose-made to intercept and dogfight. They are perhaps the most important part of an airforce as they serve both a defensive role against enemy close air support and bombers and also an offensive role by escorting our own such aircraft."
      anc_airforce_5:0 "Basic CAS"
      anc_airforce_5_desc:0 "A war cannot be won through airpower alone, at least not with our current technological ability, as such we should focus on craft that will assist our ground troops in achieving their objectives. Close Air Support will batter our enemies from the sky, acting as effectively mobile artillery batteries for our men to call upon when needed." 
      anc_airforce_6:0 "Basic Bombers"
      anc_airforce_6_desc:0 "When conducting invasions it will often become necessary for us to neutralise our enemy’s industry and infrastructure. Heavy craft with an expanded cargo bay modified to contain large amounts of ordinance that can be dropped on these strategic targets are needed. \n \n Unfortunately, our engineers do not believe that new bomber designs will be viable for at least a few years, as such we will need to make use of our current stock of mishmash craft and simply modify them to suit our needs."
      anc_airforce_7:0 "Standardized Doctrines"
      anc_airforce_7_desc:0 "With our advancements in the fields of aircraft design we may once again continue our work on learning the art of the air war. Along with this we should also make sure that our new doctrines, along with our earlier ones are properly implemented by our pilots."
      anc_airforce_8:0 "Advanced Fighters"
      anc_airforce_8_desc:0 "Our fighters are now some of the best on Terra. Our air force’s theatre-wide stratagems have developed to the point that we can cover an operational area with much fewer planes than were previously required. In addition to this, our pilots have been drilled extensively, mastering all tenets of an air war with unmatched proficiency. At this point there is little, save the quality of our craft, that separates us from the air-wings deployed by the empires that came before Old Night."
      anc_airforce_9:0 "Advanced CAS"
      anc_airforce_9_desc:0 "Our close air support squadrons are now some of the best on Terra. Cooperation between the arms of the military have allowed for much more efficient and precise tactical bombardments during battles. Our CAS pilots border on suicidal devotion during both diving and overhead attacks, willing to charge into the very jaws of an AA battery if it means securing an objective. "
      anc_airforce_10:0 "Advanced Bombers"
      anc_airforce_10_desc:0 "Our bombers are now some of the best on Terra. New optics have been installed in all bombers currently in active service that are far more precise than any previous model, enabling far more efficient and devastating strikes on targets. Further additions include more provisions for longer raids and a revised training schedule, meant to further improve the accuracy and precision of our bomber crews."
      anc_airforce_11:0 "Advanced Doctrines"
      anc_airforce_11_desc:0 "Finally, our engineers and theorists have reached a level of air-warfare theory that just a few years ago would have been considered downright impossible, pure fiction even. Yet, as our air force has grown, so too has its tactical codex. \n \n Perhaps however, it was only a matter of time before our understanding of air-warfare expanded far past what we had previously considered before we developed our air-force properly."
